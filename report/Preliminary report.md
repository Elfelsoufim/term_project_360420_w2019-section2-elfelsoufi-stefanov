## Residential Water Modeling

### Preliminary report for term project

##### Introdution:

Water is a valuable resource that is necessary for life and it is increasingly becoming a rare commodity [1]. The domestic water consumption has favorably (fortunately) decreased during the last century thanks, in part, to the invention of washing and dishwashing machines and to showers [2]. However, we wanted to take the next step and simulate what ideal infrastructure would be needed to optimize (or minimize) water extraction and storage.
To do so, we combine our programming knowledge with the computing power of the computer, to create a model for residential water consumption. Our goal was to model (hourly) water consumption accurately to an average North American household and then optimize the pumping power required from the water pump and the size of the water tower (where water is stored).
