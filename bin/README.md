HouseConsume.java is the elementary accurate water consumption simulator (enter number of houses and number of days to run the simulation)

UsingRootFinding5.java is the latest actual program (the most accurate).

It DOES NOT require META-INF, org and jmathplot files to run, while some previous ones did because of importing useless  libraries for our purposes.

It stores the data in a file (for the last run): First column is hours, second is water volume in water tower.

The root is the value of the pumping power in Liters per house.

At the end, it will also display the total size of the water tower required for such a town (1500 houses).
It will also dislay the water tower size in per house (Liters per house) to facilitate the comprehension of the numbers.
